Git

What is Git
- Version control system
- Allows user to keep track of multiple versions of the same file
- User can switch to a different version of the file at a given time

Terms
Author
- Specifies who made the change (author)
- What was the change that was made
- When the change was made

Hash
- Special commit ID that specifies the version of the change that was made
- Unique ID that will allow user to trace the spcific change

.git
- Folder which contains information regarding git repository
- Information of history of commits and hashes

HEAD
- Points to the latest version
- Lets say we have 50 versions for a particular file. In this case, HEAD will point to the latest file


Stages/Commands

init
- Initialize a empty working folder for git repository
- There is a folder called devops-project-batch-8 which is where we will create files for our project
- To initialize this folder to be used in git use the command
	git init

Untracked
- When the files are created and only part of the file system they are untracked
- For eg) Let's assume there are 2 lovers with text files: jack.txt and jill.txt
- At this stage, they are not seeing each other so they are untracked ie.) they are free to see someone else at this point
- If jill elopes with another lover or if jill dies (jill.txt is deleted), then it is not posisble to track the jill's status since its untracked


Staged
- When file are added to the staged area using git add command
- For eg.) The 2 lovers jack.txt and jill.txt decide to engaged. In order to get engaged they climb on a stage
- To add themselves on the stage, they use the command 
	git add . (The dot . refers to all files in a project)
	git add jack.txt jill.txt (Only these 2 files are added)
- For some reason, if jill decides to break the engagmement and unstage herself, this can be done using the below command
	git rm --cached jill.txt
- This stage area is also called index
   

Tracked
- When files are committed into the local repository they are in tracked stage
- Now the files are a part of the git version control system
- This is achieved using git commit -m "<Commit Message>"
- The '-m' flag is used for entering a relevant message while committing the files
- For eg.) jack and jill decide to marry. In other words they decide to commit themselves to the git ecosystem
- As a part of the commitment, Jack decides to get the stars and moon for Jill
- The whole commmitment can be summed up using the command
	git commit -m "Jack will get stars and moon for Jill to get married"
- A more professional message would be
	git commit -m "feat: added jack and jill"
- Note: All the files that appear green in the staged area will be committed.

Status
- Shows a list of files which are tracked/untracked by git
- For eg.) jack and jill can check status of their relationship (committed, open, complicated) by using the command
				git status
- Output would return the following
